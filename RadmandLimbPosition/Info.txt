File Naming:
S#_C#_P#_R#, where S is subject code, C is class code, P is position code, and R is repetition code

Methodology:
EMG data corresponding to eight classes of motion were collected from 10 right-handed, healthy, normally-limbed
subjects (9 male, 1 female) within the age range of 19 to 32 years. All experiments were approved by the University of
New Brunswick’s Research Ethics Board. 

A Trigno Wireless System (Delsys Inc., USA) was used to record surface myoelectric signals. Six wireless electrodes
were equally spaced placed around the dominant forearm, proximal to the elbow, at the position with largest muscle
bulk. The six channels of EMG were band-pass filtered (20-450Hz Butterworth) and sampled at 1 kHz by a custom data
collection system.
